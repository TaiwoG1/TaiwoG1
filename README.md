## Security Engineer/Cloud Engineer

I am a Security Engineer and Cloud Architect, building resilient, production-grade security infrastructure to protect complex digital assets. My work bridges the gap between identity governance and proactive defense, from securing virtualized environments to hardening large-scale cloud ecosystems.

- **Cloud Architecture & IAM Governance** – Architecting Zero Trust frameworks, fine-grained access control, and automated identity lifecycles across multi-cloud environments.
- **Threat Detection & Incident Response** – Engineering advanced detection logic, SIEM/SOAR orchestration, and real-time monitoring for cloud-native threats.
- **Infrastructure & Virtualization** – Deploying and securing Active Directory (ADDS) on virtualized server environments with a focus on high availability and forest security.
- **Vulnerability Management** – Executing deep-dive authenticated scans, risk-based prioritization, and automated remediation workflows to minimize attack surfaces.
- **SecOps & Automation** – Streamlining security operations through Infrastructure as Code (Bicep) and continuous security validation.

*Currently focused on bridging the gap between identity intelligence and automated threat hunting to enable self-healing, secure cloud infrastructures.*
